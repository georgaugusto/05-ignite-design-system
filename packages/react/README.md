# Rocketseat ignite course - Design System

## About
In the creation of the structure of the design system, two projects were used as reference, the ignite course project where we learned how to document React components and discovered several tools that are helping us from the implementation of the Design System to its publication, such as the Storybook , the changesets and more, and Uber's base design. These were decisive for the construction of a coherent and uniform system.

### Template
To create the basis of this week's design system, I used two projects as a basis, the ignite course project and Uber's base design.
